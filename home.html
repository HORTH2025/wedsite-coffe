                <h2>What is Coffe?</h2>
                <p>Coffee is a beloved beverage brewed
                    from roasted coffee beans, which are
                    the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.
                    Here's a breakdown of what makes coffee so special.
                    Turns out that coffee's good for more than jump-starting our mornings or keeping us awake during
                    meetings.
                    A lot of recent research suggests that coffee offers a host of potential health benefits.
                    <br>
                    <br>Every day, Americans drink 400 million cups of this incredibly complex beverage,
                    which contains more than 1,000 compounds that can affect the body. The most commonly studied are
                    caffeine (a nervous-system stimulant that's known to have positive cognitive effects) and
                    polyphenols (antioxidants that can help slow or prevent cell damage).
                </p>

                <br>
                <h2>Why are we drinking coffee?</h2>
                <p>People most commonly drink coffee to increase mental alertness.
                    Coffee is also used for diabetes, cancer, heart disease,
                    high blood pressure, dementia, and many other conditions,
                    but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.</p>

                <h2>What are the benefits of coffee?</h2>
                <p>Caffeine is the first thing that comes
                    to mind when you think about coffee. But coffee also
                    contains antioxidants and other active substances that may reduce
                    internal inflammation and protect against disease, say nutrition experts
                    from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p><br>

                <h2>Is coffee good or bad for health?</h2>
                <p>High intake of boiled, unfiltered coffee has been associated
                    with mild increase in cholesterol levels. The bottom line? Your coffee
                    habit is probably fine and may even have some benefits.
                    But if you have side effects from coffee,
                    such as heartburn, nervousness or insomnia, consider cutting back.</p>
